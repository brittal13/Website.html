<ul>
   <li>You do not always have to fight in every unfriendly encounter—sometimes it would probably be best to talk to the enemies or try to run away</li></br>
   <li>Take notes on plot events, NPCs that you meet, and anything else you think could even be remotely important; this will help to recap the previous session and to remember important details</li></br>
   <li>It's D&D, roleplaying is important; I will try my best to role play, and I hope everyone tries their best to roleplay too</li></br>
</ul>
