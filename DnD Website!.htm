   <p>Hello friends, and welcome to the website I have been working on for our Dungeons and Dragons campagin! This summer I have been learning to code using HTML, HTML5, and CSS, and I am excited to code a simple website just for the campaign this semester.</p>
   <p>As you probably know, the campaign will begin on the island-nation called Anima. Anima is currenly being ruled by Queen Abrielle, a young half-elf who is popular with most of the citizens. Anima consists of the large island and also the smaller islands that are found on the map. There is one town in the nation, called Kardia, that sits at the center of the large island. Kardia contains Queen Abrielle's castle in the middle on a hill and is surrounded by various shops, restaurants, and houses. Beyond Kardia lies mainly forests. These forests are a special type of rainforest called a Celtic rainforest, and they are known for their lush shades of green and many species of mosses, fungi, and trees. Within the forests in each "corner" of the island lie the nation's villages.</p>
   <p>There are four villages, and a different race is the main occupant of each. In the northeast section lies Holderhek where most of the nation's mountains dwarves live. In the southeast "corner" lies Cincinnatus, a village that consists of a diverse group of humans. These two villages are closest to the nation's only mountain range, Pelion. Beyond those two villages lies another in the northwest corner, Raulnor. The citizens of Raulnor are forest gnomes, and the final village, Harmonia, consists of wood elves. In general the villages have occupants of mainly one race; this differs greatly from Kardia where all four races are nearly equally represented in its inhabitants.</p>
   <p>I could go on and on about this world and the specifics, but I hope that everyone is able to uncover these specifics as we go through the campaign. In the beginning, what is important is that you know you were sent for by Queen Abrielle to help find the source of the sudden monsters that have invaded Anima and get rid of them.</p>

   <p align="center">As I said earlier, the forests that take up a majority of Anima's land are Celtic rainforests, known for their lush growth and fungi, which may or may not be like this beauty:</p></br></br>
